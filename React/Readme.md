# React Notes & Projects

This folder is a collection of my notes and practice projects while learning **ReactJS**.  
Each subfolder explores different ideas, concepts, or small applications.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

- **FoodList/**  
  A simple app for listing and managing food items. Practice with components and props.

- **Notes/**  
  Personal notes about React fundamentals: components, hooks, state, props, etc.

- **Projects/**  
  A collection of mini-projects built while learning React. These cover a mix of UI, state, and API experiments.

  A starter playground created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for quick prototyping in React.
